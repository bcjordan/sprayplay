{"name":"Spray Play","body":"![Spray Play screenshot](https://github.com/bcjordan/sprayplay/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### How to Play\r\n\r\nSpray Play is a two player game in which you try to knock objects into each your opponent's goal area using your nifty pellet cannon.\r\n\r\nThe controls are simple: just press your finger on your side of the screen in the direction you'd like to spray your pellets.\r\n\r\nIf you successfully send that object into your opponent's area, you collect it as a trophy -- a gleeful memory of your opponent's shame.\r\n\r\n### Where to get the game\r\n\r\nTo get the source above, click on one of the package links above or clone the repository at http://github.com/bcjordan/sprayplay\r\n\r\nTo build the source, you'll need the [Corona Simulator](http://developer.anscamobile.com/).\r\n\r\nYou can also [request to be added](http://tflig.ht/Jh8NIv) to my game testing group to test on an iOS device via TestFlight.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Spray Play?
